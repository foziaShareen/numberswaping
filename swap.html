// before ES6 we swap two numbers like following
let firstNumber = 15;
let secondNumber = 10; 
let temp = firstNumber;
firstNumber=secondNumber;
secondNumber=temp;
console.log(`the value of first number is ${firstNumber}.and the value of second number is ${secondNumber}`);
// but now it is easy by following method
let a=10;
let b=15;
[a,b]=[b,a];
// now print the values
console.log(`the a is = ${a} and b is ${b}`);
// how to you think is it not easy? comment it
